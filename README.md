This is a project that is designed to ask the user to input a number 
the function creaqted will chek whether the number belongs in the fibonacci sequence or not
the project is to be done in the python programming language with each step laid out carefully in this document

PREREQUISITE KNOWLDEGE:

The fibonnaci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number after the second
number (or third number if counting from 0) is the sum of the two numbers that preceeded it.

FORMULAE:
 There are a few ways of finding out if a number is part of the fibonacci series or not

 a.
  binets fromula :
 for an integer n where Fn is the nth number in the sequence/series, Fn = (phi^n(1 - phi)^n )/ sqrt(5)
 where phi is a constant called the golden ratio = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 0r 1.6180
 it states that if Fn is a constant, then n is a part of the fibonacci series.


 b. 
  PREFECT SQUARES:  (flawed method)
  if a number n is part of a fibonacci series, then 5(n)^2 + 4 or 5(n)^2 - 4 is always a perfect square
